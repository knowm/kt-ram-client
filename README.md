# Knowm API Account Registration Required

Before you can use the knowm.ai memristor array web service you will need to obtain the following:

1. server name
2. username
3. password

To run the examples, these values must be added to the `com.knowm.kt_ram_client.HostInfo.java` class file.

Please [contact us](https://knowm.com/pages/contact-us) if you are interested in the service, as we are 
in private beta at the moment.  

# Hello World

Please see [Introduction.md](documentation/Introduction.md) for a general overview. Code examples can be found
in the `com.knowm.kt_ram_client.examples` package. 

# HTTP End Points

While this client is Java-based, all interaction with the web-service occurs via standard HTTP GET and POST requests with industry-standard JSON data returned. An overview of the end points is available in the [EndPoints.md](documentation/EndPoints.md) file.
